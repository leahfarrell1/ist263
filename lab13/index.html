            <h1>About Leah Farrell</h1>
            <p>My name is Leah Farrell, a Policy Studies and Citizenship & Civic Engagement major with minors in French and Information Management & Technology. I am interested in going into the government consulting field with a concentration on housing policy.</p>
            
            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>I have mobilized some of my interest through various work experiences including an internship with the Neighborhood and Business Development Department in the City of Syracuse. During this internship, I worked to understand the relationship between Syracuse landlords and Section 8 housing and develop an economic redevelopment plan for the East Adams neighborhood.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I helped co-write a literature review called "Beyond the Viaduct" which contextualizes the I-81 viaduct and its relationship to respiratory health on local communities. This review also explored Syracuse University's current commitment to the city of Syracuse and possible models in which its involvement with local communities can be improved.</p>
            
            <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
            <p>Beyond my academic and work experiences, I love to run, spend time with friends and family, and read. Currently, my favorite book is The Great Alone by Kristin Hannah (or anything Kristin Hannah writes). One of my favorite TV shows is "Gilmore Girls" which is based on my home town, New Milford, CT.</p>
            
            <p>These diverse experiences and interests have shaped my passion for policy work, while my Connecticut roots and love for activities like running and reading help me maintain perspective and balance in pursuing my professional goals.</p>
