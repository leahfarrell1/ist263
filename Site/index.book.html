          <h4>The Nightingale</h4>
          <p>
            Set in Nazi-occupied France during WWII, The Nightingale tells the story of two sisters—Vianne Mauriac and Isabelle Rossignol—who resist the German occupation in their own distinct ways. While Vianne struggles to protect her daughter and help Jewish children escape, Isabelle joins the French Resistance, becoming the celebrated "Nightingale" who guides downed Allied airmen across the Pyrenees to safety.
