What begins as an adventurous escape quickly transforms into a harrowing story of survival, both against the brutal Alaskan wilderness and the more dangerous threat within their own home.
        <br>
        Hannah masterfully captures the raw, unforgiving landscape of Alaska as a metaphorical backdrop to the family's internal struggles.
