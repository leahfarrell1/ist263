        About Leah Farrell:
            Leah Farrell is a dedicated Policy Studies and Citizenship & Civic Engagement major with minors in French and Information Management & Technology. Passionate about housing policy and government consulting, Leah has actively engaged in the field through various work experiences, including an internship with the Neighborhood and Business Development Department in the City of Syracuse. During this role, she analyzed the relationship between Syracuse landlords and Section 8 housing and contributed to an economic redevelopment plan for the East Adams neighborhood. She also co-authored a literature review, "Beyond the Viaduct," which examines the impact of the I-81 viaduct on respiratory health in local communities and explores ways Syracuse University can enhance its involvement with the city.

A devoted reader, she is particularly fond of Kristin Hannah's novels, with The Great Alone ranking as one of her favorites. She also loves watching Gilmore Girls, a show based on her hometown of New Milford, CT. These diverse experiences and interests not only fuel her passion for policy work but also provide balance and perspective as she navigates her career aspirations.
